# WEIGHT_CONVERSION_PROGRAM

The Weight Conversion Program is a simple Python script that allows users to convert weights between pounds and kilograms. It provides a user-friendly interface for choosing the conversion direction, entering the weight, and obtaining the converted result.

To use the Weight Conversion Program, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weight-conversion-program.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd weight-conversion-program

3. Run the script:
    python weight_converter.py

Once the script is running, follow the on-screen instructions to:

- Choose the conversion direction (pounds to kilograms or kilograms to pounds).
- Enter the weight when prompted.

The program will then perform the conversion and display the result with two decimal places.

Example:

Choose conversion direction:
1. Pounds to Kilograms
2. Kilograms to Pounds
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Enter weight in pounds: 150
150.0 pounds is equal to 68.18 kilograms.
```
